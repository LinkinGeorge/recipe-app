## Georgs recipe app

This is a recipe app developed with the Ionic Framework using Angular 4. The recipe data comes from my [recipe webapp](http://georgs-recipes.herokuapp.com/recipes) which uses a MEAN Stack and provides a basic API I can work with.

This app is not intended to be cloned and served, as there's some environment information necessary to run it (and it's excluded from source control) and it's also very tied to my own recipe API. However, feel free to have a look at the code to use it for your own projects or get inspired :)
