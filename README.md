## Georgs recipe app

This is a recipe app developed with the Ionic Framework using Angular 4. The recipe data comes from my [recipe webapp](http://georgs-recipes.herokuapp.com/recipes) which uses a MEAN Stack and provides a basic API I can work with.

To see it in the browser you would first need to have ionic and cordova globally installed like this:
`npm install -g ionic cordova`

After that, you can simply run `ionic serve` or `ionic serve -l` to kind of emulate a specific device.

However, to compile it to an APK, you would need to create your own app over at [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and put this code into it. But there's a lot more involved with this, so you better follow their tutorial on how to do Native Builds in the docs.

You can also always ask me for the APK if you really want to have the app on your phone! :)
